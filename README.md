# Argone One Driver for Fedora

This package will manage the fan and power buttons in the Argon One case on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. 

Please keep in mind that the Argon One v3 on Pi 5 requires a modded EEPROM, please see the official instructions.

Thanks to [Martin Wimpress for his Ubuntu Port](https://github.com/wimpysworld/argon1-ubuntu) and Argon 40 for pretty much everything else.
